Adaptations from Oracle to MySQL (v5.4.1, 2009): 

* replace VARCHAR2 by VARCHAR. 
* replace NUMBER by  INT or FLOAT.
* CONSTRAINT [name] is allowed in MySQL only for
  PRIMARY KEY, UNIQUE, or FOREIGN KEY; 
  thus NOT NULL constraints without naming.
* Named constraints are not allowed in MySQL
  in the column definitions, but only separately as
  table constraints.
* OBJECTs and CREATE TYPE are not supported by MySQL.
  Thus, the definition of GeoCoord has been replaced by
  longitude and latitude.
  (-> modified also mondial-inputs.sql)

* MariaDB: is case-sensitive. inputs.sql is lowercase,
  => schema.sql must also be lowercase.

* Note: FOREIGN KEY CONSTRAINTs are only evaluated if
  "InnoDB" is chosen as storage engine.
